# Cycle Sprint

Author: Isa Lie

Design: The player bikes through a course on a WalkMesh, trying to reach the goal as fast as possible. Speed builds up with each key press but fades over time to emulate cycling, while the mouse-controlled orientation adds realism as the player dodges swinging obstacles and aims for the highest score.
