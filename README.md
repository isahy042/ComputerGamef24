# Gem Heist

Author: Isa Lie

Design: This game introduces a unique blend of stealth and strategy, where players must blend in with computer controlled characters while trying to reach a gem, all while avoiding detection by a player-controlled defender who can trigger laser alarms.

Networking: (TODO: How does your game implement client/server multiplayer? What messages are transmitted? Where in the code?)

Screen Shot:

How To Play:

(TODO: describe the controls and (if needed) goals/strategy.)

Sources: (TODO: list a source URL for any assets you did not create yourself. Make sure you have a license for the asset.)

This game was built with [NEST](NEST.md).
